= HeliumReborn =
HeliumReborn is a fork of Helium Mobile browser https://github.com/OrangeLabsUK/Helium-Mobile-Browser for Harmattan
and Nemo Mobile. Main change to the original is utilization of Nokia's Qt Quick Components for MeeGo to enable good 
platform integration. Code structure is also a bit different since the port started from empty project and added 
Helium code as needed, leaving some out.

Target is to merge feautres developed here to proper Helium upstream thus making this repo obsolete.
